# Terrorch
- Terrorch: Error Injection for Torch
## Usage
- See `example.ipynb`
## To-do:
- [X] Allow users to determine the device of generating and injecting errors.
- [X] Automatic error map size allocation by iterating through model.
- [ ] Support for 64-bit double precision.
- [ ] Using sparse mat as error map for large models and low error rates for compact solution.
- [ ] Implement for stuck-at-fault error (with customized error map).
- [ ] Support error injection during training.
- [ ] Support for quantized data types.
