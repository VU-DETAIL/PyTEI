# Terrorch
- Terrorch: Efficient Error Injection for Deep Learning Models using Torch
## Usage
- See notebooks in `./examples`
## To-do:
- [X] Allow users to determine the device of generating and injecting errors.
- [X] Automatic error map size allocation by iterating through model.
- [X] Support for save and load of error maps with option to save as sparse tensor.
- [X] Implement for stuck-at-fault error (with customized error map).
- [X] Implement error mitigation methods of activation limiting and selective bit protection (SBP).
- [ ] Allow users to specify individual parameters for error mitigation.
- [ ] Support for random value error.
- [ ] Support for 64-bit double precision.
- [ ] Support error injection during training.
- [ ] Support for quantized data types.
